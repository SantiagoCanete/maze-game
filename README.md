# Build and solve the maze

## Description
The goal of this package is to teach beginner programmers the basics of Python and programming logic. You will be able
to build a random maze and program your avatar to find its way out of the maze. The avatar is given a set of actions it
can take and information about the maze it can access. The users will be able to write their own solution and see the 
result in the GUI. 

## Setup your environment
- Download the latest Python 3 version ([go to download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- It is preferable if you install an integrated development environment (IDE). I suggest you try PyCharm Education 
edition. You can find detailed instructions at the [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) website.

- You will not need to install any additional packages or dependencies. 
- Download the **maze-game.zip** package from Github and extract all files to a desired location.
